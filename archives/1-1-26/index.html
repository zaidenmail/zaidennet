    <p>New Year, New Newsletter! </p>
	<br>
	<p>Looking back on this year... I didn't get a lot done.
	But at least now it's time to look into the future!<p>
	
	<h2 class="purple">SOME GOALS...</h2>

    <p>Firstly, I hope to be able to play the piano at least an hour or two a day.
	I am finally ready to learn and have everything set up for me to be able to sit
	down and really give it a shot.</p>
	<p> And on the topic of music, I hope to learn to mix and produce those songs
	I play on the piano into real songs! And to upload them somewhere...<p>
	
	<p>I recently made a song that was for a short game I didn't work on and have
	nothing to do with really. It isn't good, but for being my first song I thought I 
	might as well put it here!<p>

  <h2 class="purple">SPEAKING OF "HERE"</h2>
	
	<p> Welcome to the Newsletter! I don't expect or even mind if anyone reads this or not. 
	I am mainly doing this for two reasons.<p>
	<br>
	<p> 1. I wanted the domain zaiden.net...<p>
	<p> 2. I wanted to learn how to make a website, and thought it would be nice to look back on all of this
	at the start of 2027, and see whats happened since. And this will also help me learn to write better... hopefully
  
	<br><br>
	<p> I spent an enourmous $12 to have this for the next year, so (with my goal of weekly newsletters) there will be an amazing 52 by next year!<p>
	<p> I don't think I will have a problem doing more than that though if something big is happening, or I just want to talk about something in particular and can't wait until next week.<p>
	
	<h2 class="purple">IN THE MEAN TIME..</h2>
	<p> Check out the rest of the website! And sign up for the mailing box to know when these go live if you are actually reading this..<p>
	<p> If you don't want to sign up though, you can bookmark the tab you're on now (unless you are on the archives). zaiden.net/newsletter will always show the newest one!
	<br><br><br>
	<p> That's all for now! Happy New Year!<p>
