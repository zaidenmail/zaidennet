	<span class="purple">WEEK 2 NEWSLETTER</span></h1>

    <p>Time Is Ticking... </p>
	<br>
	<p>The first week of this year has already flown by!
	So far I've kept up with all my resolutions I said last time, including playing the piano. I haven't gotten much better though.
	There has been something that's been taking up most of my time though...<p>
	
	<h2 class="purple">GAMING..</h2>

    <p>More specifically ARC Raiders. This has been my favorite game in a long time, and I've been addicted to it. (I've been playing for about a week and have 50 hours)</p>
	<p> But it isn't just arc raiders! (although it's mainly arc raiders). Balatro has been really fun to, I got it on my switch this past week and am going to go for C++<p>
	
	<p>I also customized my switch to make it all white, and was about to buy purple joysticks, but they just released the first color option for the switch 2 and it has them built in! so im thinking of buying those.<p>
	
	  <h2 class="purple">MUSIC?</h2>
	<p>As far as music goes, I dont really have updates. I worked on some at the start of this year and then ARC Raiders took over.<p>
	<p> Here is a song I made at the start of the year and never really finished.<p>

   <h2 class="purple">Thank You For Reading!</h2>
   
   <p>Thanks for reading! I am excited to update next week with whatever else I've done.<p>
